        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p> An element is a type of content on a webpage. HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage. An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.
        </p>
        <h3>Inside the "head" we put the metadata</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Declarations! aren't case sensitive but HTML are. (case sensitive)</li>
          <li>title-defines the title for our webpage. useful for search engine optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>style-defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>base-defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>link-connects to an external resorce to the HTML document</li>
          <li>meta-defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author, and veiwport</li>
          <li>script-embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
          <li>/head-head close tag (any tag is closed by using the /)</li>
          <li>charset-character encoding</li>
          <li>http-equiv-sets an http header for content</li>
          <li>veiwport-default veiw for our webpage</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The "body"</h3>
        <p>body-is a semantic element, it is important to use semantics so your HTML is easier to read by other deverlopers and the browser. It's also important for accessibility. Not all elements are semantic, but it's best to use semantic elements whenever possible.</p>
        <p>Examples of non semantic elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>div-to create a division on the page</li>
          <li>span-to create and inline division</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag, These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside. We put content inbetween these so the browser knows how to treat them. (like writing a paper)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>h1-first header. h1,h2,h3... are the level of heading. (organizes your text so its easier to read.) </li>
          <li>p-is a paragragh it formats the text to wrap on the webpage</li>
          <li>ul,ol,and il- represent: ul unordered list, ol ordered list, and li list items. Can represent as a numbered list or bullet points. </li>
          <li>img-information about images that are displayed on the webpage the "src" attribute is most important because it says the location of the image. The "alt" attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>br-creates line break.</li>
          <li>a-(stands for anchor) creates inks to the same webpage or other webpages. The "href" points to the "url" for the link</li>
          <li>section- elements are semantic elements that define a section in a dociment that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>id- is a way to identify elements and select them. </li>
          <li>rel- attribute specifies relationship between current doc and linked doc</li>
          <li>href- is using relative path (being location of the linked doc from the location of the current doc, like going from your house to the store)</li>
          <li>./assets/style.css- current location/ file linked doc is located/linked doc</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS- style an element directly, they apply to a specific tag. useful for quick perminant changes, each style must be edited individually</li>
          <li>internal style sheet- embed an entire style sheet into the HTML file, contains CSS rules that only apply to that page. you can configure with CSS and IDs, that identify elements, to style multiple things. a single change will apply to all tagged elements</li>
          <li>external CSS style sheet- most common. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. when using we link the file using the "link" element placed in the HTML's</li>
          <li>declarations- (the rules) contains the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>selector- defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declorations, will apply</li>
          <li>margin- indicates the space we want around the outside of the element</li>
          <li>padding- adds space around the inside of an element. (when padding is increased the element gets bigger)</li>
          <li>star-declare all elements on the page will have the style properties listed</li>
          <li>multiple elements can be grouped together using a comma if they you want them to have the same styling</li>
          <li>DRY code-Do not repeate yourself is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>text-align-is a way of changing the alignment of text on a page</li>
          <li> img- assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>
          <li>display-is assigned with the block value wich assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
          <li>Class attribute- allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning a rule to a class attribute</li>
          <li>width- width of the element</li>
          <li>border-assigns a border with specified width</li>
          <li>box-shadow-adds a shadow effect around element's frame. a box shadow is describes by x and y offsets relitive to the element, blur and spread radius, and color</li>
          <li>assigning colors in CSS can be done by using semantic references such as gray or blue. we can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex#</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>cd- change directory ex: cd downloads, takes you to downloads</li>
          <li>pwd- print working directory allows you to see where you are</li>
          <li>cd ..- takes you back one step in the directory</li>
          <li>mkdir- creates a new directory ex: mkdir bootcamp made a new folder in my user labled bootcamp</li>
          <li>ls- allows you to see the list of files and directories in the computer</li>
          <li>touch- seems to create a file that is specified (wasnt explained) ex: touch first-day.txt</li>
          <li>SSH key- is an access credential for the secure shell (SSH) network protocol.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>GitHub is a cloud-based service that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code.
          (why have I had a git hub since 2016)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>repo- is a repository (folder for your project)</li>
          <li>Branch- workspace where you can make changes that dont affect the live site ( the base code) like bitcoin lol</li>
          <li>Markdown (.md)- file format for github (easily converts to hdml)</li>
          <li>commit changes- saving a new version of a file (when you add, edit or delete) adds a new branch like bitcoin lol</li>
          <li>pull Request (PR)- asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch. (way to review work with others) be 	specific in your descriptions.</li>
          <li>Merge-PR approved and your changes are pulled into the main branch (changes publish to live site)</li>
          <li>issue- way to report new task or content fixes kinda like a note or a pin best practise: delete note when finished 	and link Doc when you have one. label issues accordingly</li>
          <li>README- file contains other information about the code</li>
          <li>git status- shows you where you are in the repo tree</li>
          <li>git checkout main-allows you to check if your updated with the main branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b "title"- creates a new branch "with the title you name it"</li>
          <lit>git- command prefex? of git</lit>
