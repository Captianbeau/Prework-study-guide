        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p> An element is a type of content on a webpage. HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage. An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.
        </p>
        <h3>Inside the "head" we put the metadata</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Declarations! aren't case sensitive but HTML are. (case sensitive)</li>
          <li>title-defines the title for our webpage. useful for search engine optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>style-defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>base-defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>link-connects to an external resorce to the HTML document</li>
          <li>meta-defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author, and veiwport</li>
          <li>script-embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
          <li>/head-head close tag (any tag is closed by using the /)</li>
          <li>charset-character encoding</li>
          <li>http-equiv-sets an http header for content</li>
          <li>veiwport-default veiw for our webpage</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The "body"</h3>
        <p>body-is a semantic element, it is important to use semantics so your HTML is easier to read by other deverlopers and the browser. It's also important for accessibility. Not all elements are semantic, but it's best to use semantic elements whenever possible.</p>
        <p>Examples of non semantic elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>div-to create a division on the page</li>
          <li>span-to create and inline division</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag, These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside. We put content inbetween these so the browser knows how to treat them. (like writing a paper)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>h1-first header. h1,h2,h3... are the level of heading. (organizes your text so its easier to read.) </li>
          <li>p-is a paragragh it formats the text to wrap on the webpage</li>
          <li>ul,ol,and il- represent: ul unordered list, ol ordered list, and li list items. Can represent as a numbered list or bullet points. </li>
          <li>img-information about images that are displayed on the webpage the "src" attribute is most important because it says the location of the image. The "alt" attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>br-creates line break.</li>
          <li>a-(stands for anchor) creates inks to the same webpage or other webpages. The "href" points to the "url" for the link</li>
          <li>section- elements are semantic elements that define a section in a dociment that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>id- is a way to identify elements and select them. </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS notes here</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>cd- change directory ex: cd downloads, takes you to downloads</li>
          <li>pwd- print working directory allows you to see where you are</li>
          <li>cd ..- takes you back one step in the directory</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>GitHub is a cloud-based service that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code.
          (why have I had a git hub since 2016)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>repo- is a repository (folder for your project)</li>
          <li>Branch- workspace where you can make changes that dont affect the live site ( the base code) like bitcoin lol</li>
          <li>Markdown (.md)- file format for github (easily converts to hdml)</li>
          <li>commit changes- saving a new version of a file (when you add, edit or delete) adds a new branch like bitcoin lol</li>
          <li>pull Request (PR)- asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch. (way to review work with others) be 	specific in your descriptions.</li>
          <li>Merge-PR approved and your changes are pulled into the main branch (changes publish to live site)</li>
          <li>issue- way to report new task or content fixes kinda like a note or a pin best practise: delete note when finished 	and link Doc when you have one. label issues accordingly</li>
          <li>README- file contains other information about the code</li>
        </ul>
